       <h2>Enchiladas Verdes</h2>
            <p>Delicious enchiladas verdes with homemade spicy tomatillo sauce. I got this recipe from an amazing cook from Puebla and it is the best I've ever tried! I've been perfecting it for over 15 years and realized it was time to share it when my foodie friends tried to drink the sauce out of the saucepan. Be conservative with the Mexican crema and cotija cheese.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ¼ pounds small green tomatillos, husks removed</li>
                <li>3 serrano peppers</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>9 corn tortillas</li>
                <li>3 cups water</li>
                <li> 4 tbsps chicken bouillon</li>
                <li>1/2 store bought rotisserie chicken</li>
                <li>mexivan crema</li>
                <li>1 cup cilantro</li>
                <li>1 cup cotija cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high.</li>
                <li>Cook tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic on the hot griddle, turning occasionally, until toasted and blackened — about 5 minutes for garlic, 10 minutes for peppers, and 15 minutes for tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Lightly fry tortillas, one at a time, in hot oil until warmed through, 3 to 5 seconds per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                <li>Place toasted tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a blender. Add water and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve chicken bouillon in the mixture, reduce heat, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Soak tortillas in sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds. Fill each tortilla with shredded chicken and sprinkle with sauce. Roll up tortillas and place seam-side down in a serving dish.</li>
                <li>Spoon a generous amount of sauce over rolled tortillas. Top with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour remaining sauce on top or serve on the side.</li>
            </ol>
